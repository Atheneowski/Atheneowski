- 👋 Hi, I’m @Atheneowski
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of different things! The main ones would have to be my Malinois, cooking, thriving in the PNW, crocheting, and Pokémon [151].
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make sourdough 🍞
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever fills your cup.
- 📫 You can best reach me via slack
- 💎 Fun fact: I took 8 years of French.
